# Introduction

Sovol SV06 is a budget printer with compact functions. It adopts the movement structure of polished rod and bearings, thus, no wheels on the printer anymore!
It’s with an All Metal Hotend and a Planetary Gear Direct Drive Extruder, which supports printing with soft TPU and high-temperature filament, such as PETG, ABS, Carbon Fiber, etc. 
PEI Plate, 25 point Auto Leveling, 32bit Silent Mainboard, Dual Z axis, and Belt Tensioner are all pre-installed on the SV06. Welcome to check more on sovol3d.com

# Notice

This is an <b>experimental<b> source code for Sovol SV06 to get it closer to its full potential. For detailed changes check latest commits.
The damage caused by modifying firmware also using the third party firmware will lose the 1 year warranty. If you need support, it’s recommended to reflash the stock firmware before contacting sovol.

I can’t provide tech help for users to modify source code, but if you need me to add more functions, create a pull request.
